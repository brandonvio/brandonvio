# brandonv.io

Greetings. My career experience so far has been mostly fullstack software engineering. However, throughout my career I've been involved in many other aspects of system delivery. My first tech job was with **Arcadia Software** who built the software that ran Qzar (at the time being the largest lazer tag franchise in the country). Part of my role was to configure the system for each new lazer tag center. This included installing the OS and the respective software for all 5 computers that ran the center, as well as networking the computers and validating connectivity and operations. Another highlight is building out and migrating all operational servers to a Hyper-V cluster for **Sgt Grit Marine Specialities** on top of a large Dell SAN for high availability. I also built out several CI/CD processes for companies such as **Broadlane** and **Crossmark** using CruiseControl.NET.

Moving forward I'm focusing in on Solution Architecture and DevOps culture esp. as relates to cloud and AWS. I want to be a part of the digitial transformation that is changing the very nature of organizations around the world. My goal is to build amazing systems that provide transformative value.

## NSS Overview

NSS is a system I worked on during my time at American Fidelity. NSS is the name of the integration systems for a larger product called FFSolutions. NSS processed hundreds of files every day, each file containing thousands of policy records. A robust ETL process esued for each record. The following document contains screenshots of the application. All of the screens and processes I personally designed, developed and supported.

## Lonza MAST

Lonza is a freelance client I have been working with. Part of my work with the MAST team at Lonza has been to implement devops processes for the MAST Client Service application. As such I built out an Azure DevOps pipeline for the application for continuous integration. I've also implemented code coverage reporting and have begun the process of increasing the code coverage for the application. [Screenshots of the pipeline](https://github.com/brandonvio/brandonvio/tree/master/documents/lonza).

# Portfolio Projects

These are projects I've worked on for about the last 6 months. Some of these projects started out as coding challenges and were built out into a full functioning application. Rythm.cc started out as an idea to do machine learning using financial data and turned into a Jenkins/Kubernetes exercise. Each project is using CI/CD and is hosted in live environment on AWS or Azure.
