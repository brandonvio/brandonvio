## NSS Overview

NSS is a system I worked on during my time at American Fidelity. NSS is the name of the integration systems for a larger product called FFSolutions. NSS processed hundreds of files every day, each file containing thousands of policy records. A robust ETL process esued for each record. The following document contains screenshots of the application. All of the screens and processes I personally designed, developed and supported.
