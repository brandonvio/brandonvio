## NSS Overview

NSS is a system I worked on during my time at American Fidelity. NSS is the name of the integration systems for a larger product called FFSolutions. NSS processed hundres of files every day, each file containing thousands of records containing policy information. A robust ETL process esued for each record. The following document contains screenshots of the application. It also includes screenshots from my Instagram for more context as me as person.
